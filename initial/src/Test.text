Chromedriver attached to the project was not running as expected,
hence I had to localise the path.

After I got the code running on Chrome driver, I found that the 
username/password are not working, so I wanted to add a test case for 
checking the results page instead.


Recommendations:
1.
I would prefer to add code to kill chromedriver from task manager with the following code

Process[] chromeDriverProcesses =  Process.GetProcessesByName("chromedriver");

foreach(var chromeDriverProcess in chromeDriverProcesses)
{
     chromeDriverProcess.Kill();
}

2. Assertions can be added to test all the available eliments on the landing page & homepage
3. Add more details in comments so that it's easier for the rest of the team members for maintenance
